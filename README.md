# rest-api

A Polymer element providing declarative data bindings to REST API.

## Example

```html
<rest-api url="http://localhost:3000">
  <rest-api-resource name="books" collection="{{books}}"></rest-api-resource>
</rest-api>
```

## Dependencies

Element dependencies are managed via [Bower](http://bower.io/). You can
install that via:

    npm install -g bower

Then, go ahead and download the element's dependencies:

    bower install

## Running Development Server

`<rest-api>` needs a REST API (sic) to work with. This repository includes a
development server configuration based on
[BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/) and
[JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), that is very handy to
use. Just install npm dependencies:

    npm install

Then you can run it with:

    npm start

Once running, your browser should automatically navigate to the element's page.
By default, it is served from `http://localhost:3000/components/rest-api/`.

You can also browse the API at `http://localhost:3000/api/`. The mock data is
generated automatically and stored in db.json file. To regenerate the API data,
delete the db.json file and start the server again.

## Running tests

Navigate to the `/test` directory of the element to run its tests, e.g.:
`http://localhost:3000/components/rest-api/test/`

The tests are done with the [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester).
